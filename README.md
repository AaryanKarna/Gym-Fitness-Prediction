# Gym-Fitness-Prediction
This project predicts the number of calories burned during physical activity based on user input and other physiological features. The model is built using Python and employs Linear Regression as the machine learning algorithm. It provides insights into health trends and enables personalized predictions for users based on their fitness data.

Key Features:

Data Handling:
Reads and processes a health-related dataset containing workout data.
Cleans and prepares features such as age, height, weight, and exercise metrics.

Machine Learning:
Trains a Linear Regression model to predict calories burned.
Evaluates the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

User Interaction:
Allows manual input of user features to predict calories burned.

Visualization:
Visualizes actual vs. predicted values using a scatter plot for model performance assessment.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
scikit-learn for machine learning and model evaluation.
matplotlib for data visualization.
